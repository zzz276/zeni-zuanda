      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p className='cs-bio'>
        I'm currently studying Mobile Application and Technology at the School of Computer Science, BINUS University.
        My favorite problems live where design systems, real-time data, and human-centered experiences intersect.
        Whether I'm prototyping Flutter widgets, shipping Kotlin micro-apps, or wiring sensors to microcontrollers,
        I write code that feels like a conversation between logic and art.
      </p>
      <p className='cs-bio'>
        Outside of coursework, I document rapid experiments, tinker with creative coding sketches,
        and iterate on accessible, inclusive UI frameworks for mobile. I love bringing futuristic,
        neon-lit concepts into approachable experiences.
